# Badge(s) Description
We apply for available, functional and reusable badges.

Reasons why the artifact deserves that badges:

#### Available
All the source code and data are shared in a public GitHub repository. Then we have also created the artifact object, obtained a DOI and persistent access from open-access site Zenodo so that the artifact can be easily accessed, shared and cited.

#### Functional
1. All the source code to generate results are shared. We have modularized the code and sorted in respective folders to make it reusable.  
2. Necessary steps to install and setup environment is documented.
3. The necessary external datasets are included to run the models.
4. The results are organized into `.csv` files.
5. Results can be verified using data presented in the paper.

#### Reusable
1. The results are generated in `.csv` which can be reused.
2. modules can be run separately and all together.
3. Bash scripts can be run with appropriate arguments to generate results.
4. Code executions can be completed using command line.
